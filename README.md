We are assigned to program a roulette game in python.

Assume board looks like:

Ideas on project scope:

* Support the following bets:
  * Color (Red/Black)
  * Odd/Even
  * Inside number guess (0-36)
* Only supports 1 player but multiple bets
* Program asks for bets
  * first asks for bet type, and then bet amount
  * continues asking, until user presses enter without entering bet type
  * bets are stored in two arrays -- one for type, and other for amount
  * support as many bets as user enters
* Program rolls (select random number between 0 and 36)
* Program calculates winnings
  * loop through bets arrays, and calculate win/loss from that bet
  * accumulate win/loss amounts, and display at end
* Bonus: ask if double stakes?
